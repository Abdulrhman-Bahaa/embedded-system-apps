# Embedded Systems Applications  

This repository contains various **embedded systems projects** that I am working on to improve my skills in **firmware development, control systems, etc**.  

## Projects Included  
### UAV Project  
=- Implementing a **PID controller** for stability  
- Sensor fusion using an **IMU**  
- PWM control for **motor speed adjustment**   

## Why I Made This Repo  
I am learning **embedded systems engineering**, and I use these projects to:  
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world applications  
- Improve **microcontroller programming**  
-  Experiment with different **communication protocols and control algorithms**  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdulrhman-Bahaa/embedded-systems-apps.git
cd embedded-systems-apps
